# WEEK TWO CODE CHALLENGE : INTERACTIVE SHOPPING LIST

## AUTHOR : NELLY MATU

## DATE : 7th July 2024

## DESCRIPTION
This challenge combines array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create an interactive shopping list application.

## OBJECTIVE
To develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## REQUIREMENTS
Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

### DOM Manipulation:
- Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
- Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
- Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

### Event Handling:
- Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
- Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
- Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

#### Bonus Features 
- Edit Items:Ensures functionality to edit existing list items.
- Persistence: Store the shopping list in local storage, allowing it to persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.

## HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE
- Adding Items:
Enter the item name into the input field.
Click the "Add" button or press Enter to add the item to the list.

- Marking Items as Purchased:
Click on the item in the list to toggle its purchased status.
Purchased items may be visually distinguished (e.g., strikethrough text).
- Clearing the List:
Click the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
